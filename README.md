# Observable

Created this thing to help me understand RxJS better. Probably will try to code more functionalities of RxJS in this little repo to understand more too.

Coded with the help of [Ben Lesh](https://twitter.com/BenLesh) and this [great presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m40cF91F8_A) of his, highly recommend it.

Todo: 
- [x] `from` function
- [x] `fromEvent` function
- [x] `filter` operator
- [ ] fix the typings of `pipe` method
- [ ] `Subject`
- [ ] `BehaviorSubject`
